      t_content: "Tara Hekmati is a fourth year physiological studies major and Iranian studies minor at UCLA. As a physiology major she has had 
                  early exposure to the world of medicine. In addition to her educational background, Tara's shadowing experiences in ENT and pulmonary 
                  medicine have allowed her to discover her passions for lifelong learning and establishing meaningful connections with the members of her community.  
                  Tara's concern for the lack of credible and consistent vaccine education offered to disadvantaged members of her community and her passion for establishing
                  connections have motivated her to create Vaccination Education to solve this problem. Tara uses her determined and goal-oriented characteristics to effectively
                  co-lead Vaccination Education."
